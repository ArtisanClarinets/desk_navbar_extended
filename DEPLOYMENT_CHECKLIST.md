## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pull Latest Code
```bash
cd /home/frappe/frappe-bench/apps/desk_navbar_extended
git pull origin main
```

### 2. Run Migration
```bash
cd /home/frappe/frappe-bench
bench --site <production-site> migrate
```

```

### 4. Restart Services
```bash
# Option A: Supervisor (zero-downtime)
sudo supervisorctl restart <bench-name>:frappe-bench-web
sudo supervisorctl restart <bench-name>:frappe-bench-workers

# Option B: Bench (simpler, brief downtime)
bench restart
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Immediate Checks (0-5 minutes)

#### 1. Site Accessibility
- [ ] Site loads without errors
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Desk loads properly

#### 2. Settings Verification
```bash
bench --site <site> console
```
```python
from desk_navbar_extended.api import get_settings
settings = get_settings()
print(f"Features loaded: {len(settings['features'])}")
# Expected: 18 features
```

#### 3. Feature Flags
- [ ] All new features visible in Settings
- [ ] Can toggle features on/off
- [ ] Changes take effect immediately

#### 4. API Endpoints
Test via console:
```python
# Test search filters
from desk_navbar_extended.api import search_filters
result = search_filters.search_with_filters(query="test", limit=5)
print(f"Search returned {result['count']} results")

# Test saved searches
from desk_navbar_extended.api import saved_searches
searches = saved_searches.list_saved_searches()
print(f"Saved searches accessible: {len(searches)}")

# Test pins
from desk_navbar_extended.api import pins
user_pins = pins.list_pins()
print(f"Pins accessible: {len(user_pins)}")
```

### Monitoring (First Hour)

#### Error Rates
```sql
-- Check for errors in telemetry
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_searches,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'error' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as errors,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'error' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as error_rate
FROM `tabDesk Navbar Search Metric`
WHERE creation >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR);
```

**Expected**: Error rate < 5%

#### Performance
```sql
-- Check API performance
SELECT 
  AVG(execution_ms) as avg_ms,
  MAX(execution_ms) as max_ms,
  MIN(execution_ms) as min_ms
FROM `tabDesk Navbar Search Metric`
WHERE creation >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR);
```

**Expected**: avg_ms < 200, max_ms < 1000

#### Usage
```sql
-- Check feature adoption
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT owner) as active_users
FROM `tabDesk Navbar Saved Search`
WHERE creation >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 DAY);
```

### Extended Monitoring (First 24 Hours)

- [ ] No increase in error logs
- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable range
- [ ] User feedback collected
- [ ] Feature adoption tracked
- [ ] No security incidents

---

## Rollback Procedure

### If Critical Issues Arise

#### Option 1: Disable Features (Recommended)
```bash
bench --site <site> console
```
```python
settings = frappe.get_single("Desk Navbar Extended Settings")

# Disable problematic features
settings.enable_smart_filters = 0
settings.enable_saved_searches = 0
settings.enable_pins = 0
# ... disable others as needed

settings.flags.ignore_permissions = True
settings.save()
frappe.db.commit()
```

#### Option 2: Code Rollback (If Necessary)
```bash
# Revert to previous version
cd /home/frappe/frappe-bench/apps/desk_navbar_extended
git log --oneline -10  # Find previous commit
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>

# Rebuild and restart
bench build --app desk_navbar_extended
bench restart
```

**Note**: Code rollback is rarely needed since features can be disabled individually.
